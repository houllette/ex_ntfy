# Phase 7 Notes — Decisions & Surprises

## The transport-boundary refactor (as the plan anticipated)

Phase 6 had coupled `Subscription` to Req's `into: :self`. This phase extracted
`ExNtfy.Subscription.Transport` — three callbacks (`connect/3`,
`handle_message/2` → `{:data, units, conn} | {:closed, units, reason} |
{:error, reason} | :unknown`, `close/1`) — with the existing logic moving
verbatim into `ExNtfy.Subscription.HTTPTransport`. The Phase 6 suite passed
unchanged after the refactor. Everything above the boundary (reconnect/backoff,
`since` resume, idle watchdog, owner monitoring, delivery styles, telemetry) is
shared; a format now selects a `{transport, parser}` pair, and `ExNtfy.Stream.WS`
implements *both* contracts (frames need no line reassembly, so its parser is
just `Message.from_json/1` per text frame).

Error fate convention at the boundary: `%Error{reason: nil}` from `connect/3`
means HTTP-level rejection → fatal; anything else is transport-level →
reconnect flow. The WS non-101 upgrade path parses the rejection body JSON, so
`{:down, %Error{code: 40301, http: 403}}` comes out fully populated.

## Decisions

- **Optional-dep guard**: `Stream.WS.ensure_available!/0` raises a clear
  `ArgumentError` (naming `:mint_web_socket`) from `build_config!` — i.e. at
  `subscribe/2` time in the caller, not inside the process. The checked module
  is read from the `:ws_dependency` app env (default `Mint.WebSocket`) purely
  so the async-unfriendly "dep missing" test can simulate absence
  (`subscription_ws_unavailable_test.exs`, `async: false`).
- **Compile-with-dep-absent**: all `Mint.WebSocket` references are runtime;
  `elixirc_options: [no_warn_undefined: [Mint.WebSocket]]` suppresses the
  undefined-module warning for consumers without the dep. (The plan suggested
  `xref: [exclude: ...]` — that spelling is deprecated in Elixir 1.20.)
  `Mint.HTTP` needs no exclusion: mint is always present via finch/req.
- **Ping→pong is handled inside the transport**, invisible to the GenServer;
  pings still reset the idle watchdog because any `{:data, ...}` (even with no
  payload units) does. Binary frames are ignored (ntfy sends text).
- **Upgrade await is a selective receive** on `:tcp`/`:ssl`-tagged messages
  only (bounded by `receive_timeout`, default 15 s), so owner-`DOWN` and timer
  messages queued during connect are not swallowed; `:unknown` stragglers from
  a previous canceled connection are dropped.
- Auth reuses `Client.encode_auth/2` (made public `@doc false`, with
  `Client.user_agent/0`) — the upgrade request carries the same
  `Authorization` header or `?auth=` param; the query test asserts the param
  base64url-decodes to the exact header value.

## Surprises / things later phases should know

- **CI caught a real race the local suite missed**: WebSocket wire data can
  ride the same TCP segment as the 101 handshake (a server pushing
  immediately on connect). The upgrade await was stashing that data as if it
  were an error body — silently swallowing the first frame. Fix: leftover
  wire bytes are kept as `pending` and the transport `send`s itself a
  synthetic `{Stream.WS, :pending, ref}` message right after connect (the
  connect runs in the subscription process, so it arrives via `handle_info`
  without changing the Transport contract). Deterministic regression test:
  the test server pushes from its WebSock `init` (`/push-on-init*` topics).
- **Dialyzer false positive on `Mint.WebSocket.new/5`**: it can't track Mint's
  private conn state through the `Mint.WebSocket.stream/2` await loop and
  concludes the `{:ok, conn, websocket}` success can never match. Scoped
  `@dialyzer {:nowarn_function, finish_upgrade: 3}` with a comment; tests
  assert the success path constantly.
- Bandit + WebSock made a pleasant test server (`test/support/ws_test_server.ex`):
  `start_supervised!` + `ThousandIsland.listener_info/1` for the random port;
  WebSock `handle_control/2` sees client pongs; pushing `{:ping, data}` frames
  works. None of the Bypass `:shutdown` trap issues from Phase 6 — no
  expectation verification.
- `websock_adapter` is at 0.6.x (plan said `~> 0.5`); bandit at 1.12,
  mint_web_socket 1.0.5 — latest everything per the standing preference.
- Coverage: 93.3% total; `stream/ws.ex` is 72.3% — the misses are deep error
  paths (upgrade timeout, mid-stream decode errors, send-frame failures, the
  `:wss` scheme arm) that would need heavy socket fault injection to reach.
- **cowlib CVEs still open** (EEF-CVE-2026-43966 MEDIUM / EEF-CVE-2026-43969
  LOW, test-only; 2.18.0 still newest as of 2026-07-05). Re-check next phase.
